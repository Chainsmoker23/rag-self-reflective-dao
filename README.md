# RAG-Enhanced Self-Reflective Governance Framework: Code Artifacts

Theoretical Design Science Research (DSR) artifact for hybrid human-AI governance in Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This repo provides executable pseudocode, simulations, and blueprints from the paper:

**Sarkar, D. (2025). A RAG-Enhanced Self-Reflective Framework for Transparent Human–AI Governance in Decentralized Systems. [Venue TBD].**

The framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-enhanced self-reflective AI, human ethical oversight, and blockchain immutability to address DAO challenges like low voter turnout (<15%), plutocratic biases (Gini >0.97), and AI opacity (hallucination risks reduced by ~25%).

## Key Components
- **Pseudocode**: Core functions for AI reflection loops, Gini fairness computation, and blockchain integration (fixed implementations from Appendix A).
- **Simulations**: Jupyter notebook demonstrating theoretical proofs (e.g., Gini convergence from 0.8 to <0.35 via quadratic voting + RAG).
- **No Deployment Needed**: Purely theoretical—run locally to verify claims (e.g., +35% fairness uplift).
